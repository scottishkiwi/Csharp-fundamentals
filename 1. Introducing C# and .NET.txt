C# code needs to be ran somehow, we do this using the .NET framework

.NET Framework is old and Windows only. This is preinstalled on Windows and offered by Microsoft. 
.NET Core is new and Open Source and runs on all Operating Systems. 

.NET can be broken into two pieces: 

CLR (Common Language Runtime)
FCL (Framework Class Library) - .NET provides a library of code to perform common activities in C#

The .NET SDK provides the .NET Runtime and the FCL. (hence Software Devlelopment Kit)

.NET CLI (dotnet): 

dotnet --info (shows version of SDK, shows runtime environment info)
dotnet -h (shows all SDK commands that are available e.g build, test, new)

Creating a new C# Project: 

dotnet new <template> 
- Lots of templates for different types of applications
- Creates the basic project structure for the application 

e.g dotnot new console (console template used for CLI applications)

- Creates a .csproj file, .cs file (C# source code)

dotnet run
- looks for a .csproj file and uses the information to run the project
- dotnet uses Nuget as a package system, allowing us to use features and code from other packages
    - When my app needs a feature in a Nuget package, the csproj will keep track of this
- run -> behind the scene, we are doing a dotnet restore, then a dotnet build (compiling cs code into a binary format that efficiently runs)
    - This is called an assembly (output of dotnet build, containing the code in a binary format)
    - Can try to run dll files without dotnet but it will complain that there is no runtime

Structure of the C# class: 

- Main method is the entry point to the application 
- Takes an args array as an argument which holds the arguments passed in via the CLI when we are running the app 
e.g  dotnet run Dan
> Hello, Dan!
- We do this using String Interpolation using $ infront of the string and then using {} for the variable:
Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {args[0]}!");

Debugging C#:

- dotnet runtime will tell us the line of code where the error occured
- can set a breakpoint (click on left side) on the line where the error occured
    - The runtime engine will pause the program and allow us to analyse the state at the time of the breakpoint
- Use Run > Debug menu in VS Code 
- Can use multiple breakpoints
