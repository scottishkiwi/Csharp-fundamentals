- A Class defines a new type of Object.
- Each class has a Main method, but you want to ensure that the method isn't bloated
- We want to seperate out (abstract out) the functionality to make it simpler to read 

- We use the class keyword to instantiate a class, and each class is usually inside its own Namespace
    - Without the namespace, the class is now in the global namespace
    - Then, if someone creates a new class with the same name in the global namespace, it will conflict with our class 

- Can have multiple Classes inside a namespace inside a file
- Most developers follow a convention where we have one Class per file 

- Cannot use the var keyword (implicit typing) for Class fields

Accessing Classes: 

- If we don't specify the access modifier on a class definition, it will default to internal
    - This means, it can only be used inside the same project. 
    - Instead we use public
