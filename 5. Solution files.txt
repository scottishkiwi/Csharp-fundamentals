Creating a Solution file: 

- Want to avoid having to build multiple projects and testing specific test projects
- Solution files keep tracks of multiple projects
    - Can open Solution file and all projects are loaded in 
    - Can 'dotnet build' a solution and will build all the projects
- We use 'dotnet new sln' in the parent directory

Adding projects to a Solution file: 

- We add projects using the dotnet sln add command and specifying the .csproj file of the project
- 'dotnet sln add src\GradeBook\GradeBook.csproj'

Now we can run the dotnet build and dotnet test commands from the parent directory that holds the src and test directores 
and .sln files.
